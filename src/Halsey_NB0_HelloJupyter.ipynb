    "About Jupyter\n",
    "-------------\n",
    "[Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) is a non-profit, open-source project that supports interactive data science and scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __JupyterLab__: a \"web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data\". If you would like to run your notebooks locally, there is excellent [installation documentation](https://jupyter.org/install) available.\n",
    "* __JupyterHub__: a \"multi-user version of the notebook designed for companies, classrooms and research labs.\" The CS department at SUNY Oswego has an instance of JupyterHub running at [https://indigo.cs.oswego.edu/jupyter](https://indigo.cs.oswego.edu/jupyter). You can use your CS credentials to log in.\n",

    "About Python\n",
    "------------\n",
    "In this course, we will be using the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language (version 3) for code examples and assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not have experience with Python, don't worry! We will start with some simple tasks that will allow you to gain familiarity with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the mean time, if you would like to learn some basic Python, there are many free resources and tutorials available online to get you started. For example: [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)\n",

    "About \"Kernels\"\n",

    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks allow you to write and execute code directly in your browser when you use a \"code\" type cell, such as the one below. The programming language that is executed is determined by the kernel that you have selected for your notebook (see the upper right-hand corner for an indicator of which kernel is selected).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are kernels available to support [many languages](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels), we will be using the default IPython kernel in this course.\n",
