    "==========================\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals for learning\n",
    "In this assignment, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Explore some [data wrangling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling) tasks that are needed to prepare data for machine learning applications\n",
    "2) Get to know some of the [open data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) that we will be using this semester\n",
    "3) Review some essential [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) features and syntax\n",
    "4) Practice thinking in the array-oriented programming paradigm\n",
    "5) Introduce some of the data processing and machine learning libraries we will be using this semester\n",

    "## What is data wrangling?\n",
    "> [Data wrangling, sometimes referred to as data munging, is the process of transforming and mapping data from one \"raw\" data form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling) \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Wrangling** is an activity often performed by **data scientists** in preparation for data analytics or machine learning applications. As a machine learning programmer, you may be provided data sets that have undergone some degree of data wrangling already, however; not all data analysis and machine learning applications require the exact same type and degree of **cleaning** and **structuring**. Therefore, you may need to revisit certain data wrangling steps in order to transform your data to work with your specific applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Main takeaway: Data is not \"one size fits all\".**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook premise\n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, imagine that you work for a large corporation, consisting of multiple teams that work on different products. The data scientists on a different team than the one you work on have some databases that they have been curating, using the following 6 data wrangling steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Data Discovery - [Discovery refers to the process of familiarizing yourself with data so you can conceptualize how you might use it.](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/data-wrangling)\n",
    "2) Structuring - [Data structuring is the process of taking raw data and transforming it to be more readily leveraged. The form your data takes will depend on the analytical model you use to interpret it.](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/data-wrangling)\n",
    "3) Cleaning - [Data cleaning is the process of removing inherent errors in data that might distort your analysis or render it less valuable. Cleaning can come in different forms, including deleting empty cells or rows, removing outliers, and standardizing inputs.](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/data-wrangling)\n",
    "4) Enriching - [Once you understand your existing data and have transformed it into a more usable state, you must determine whether you have all of the data necessary for the project at hand. If not, you may choose to enrich or augment your data by incorporating values from other datasets.](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/data-wrangling)\n",
    "5) Validating - [Data validation refers to the process of verifying that your data is both consistent and of a high enough quality.](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/data-wrangling)\n",
    "6) Publishing - [This involves making it available to others within your organization for analysis.](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/data-wrangling)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your team wants to leverage the work that has already been done by the other team by using these databases to train your ML models. Unfortunately, the transformations that have been applied to the data already are tailored to the other team's applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will have to revisit some, but not all, of these steps in order to make the data more appropriate for training your team's models. "
